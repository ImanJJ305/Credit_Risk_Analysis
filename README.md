# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
The purpose of this project is to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. I am using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling to predict credit risk and determine which sampling method should be used for analyzing this data.
